# He-Run-PSX
A small game I made to try out PSX homebrew development

- Needs to be placed in C:\dev\psxdev\source for TIMTool to find the TIM files (can be edited in Framebuffer.PSX)
- Requires PsyQ Development Kit 2.2 (might also work with PsN00bSDK)
- Requires pcsx-redux (or other emulator that can run exe files), check run.bat
- For building the ISO during testing, it uses mkpsxiso, for the releases it uses the psyQ tools


Run compile_and_run.bat to build the project and run with the emulator

Can be played online [here](https://emymin.github.io/projects/herun/)
